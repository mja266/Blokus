# Blokus

Here you'll find the source code for our project in which we created a text-based version of Blokus.

We implemented this game in the programming language OCaml. You can begin the game by opening up the terminal and typing 'make play'. Make sure you're in the right directory 'blokus'. After entering that into the terminal you'll be provided with a set of instructions, in red, explaining the game's rules and functionality. The game is designed for 4 players, but if you wish to try it out yourself you can just take the place of the remaining players. We hope you enjoy playing our text-based Blokus board game and appreciate all the hard work and thought we put into it :)
